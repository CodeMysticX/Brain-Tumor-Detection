            <h2>Welcome to Brain Health Hub</h2>
            <p>At Brain Health Hub, our mission is to provide extensive information about brain tumors to empower individuals with knowledge about brain health. Let's explore in detail:</p>

            <h3>Understanding Brain Tumors</h3>
            <p>A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). These tumors can originate in the brain itself or spread from other parts of the body to the brain.</p>

            <h3>Types of Brain Tumors</h3>
            <p>Brain tumors are classified based on their cell origin and location. The main types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glioma Tumor:</strong> Originates from glial cells and includes astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas.</li>
                <li><strong>Meningioma Tumor:</strong> Arises from the meninges, the protective layers covering the brain and spinal cord.</li>
                <li><strong>Pituitary Tumor:</strong> Develops in the pituitary gland, affecting hormonal balance.</li>
                <li><strong>No Tumor:</strong> Not all brain-related symptoms are due to tumors; some may be caused by other conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
            <p>The symptoms of a brain tumor vary based on its size, location, and impact on surrounding brain tissue. Common signs include persistent headaches, seizures, changes in vision, difficulty speaking, and personality changes.</p>

            <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
            <p>Diagnosing a brain tumor involves imaging tests (MRI, CT scans) and, in some cases, a biopsy. Treatment options depend on the tumor type and may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The goal is to remove or control the tumor while preserving brain function.</p>

            <h3>Living with Brain Tumors</h3>
            <p>Living with a brain tumor requires ongoing medical care, emotional support, and lifestyle adjustments. Patients and their families should actively participate in treatment decisions and seek guidance from healthcare professionals.</p>

            <h3>Research and Advancements</h3>
            <p>Ongoing research is essential for understanding brain tumors better. Stay informed about the latest advancements in treatment options, clinical trials, and supportive care measures.</p>

            <h3>Support and Resources</h3>
            <p>Discover support groups, online communities, and resources for individuals and families affected by brain tumors. Emotional support and connecting with others facing similar challenges can be invaluable.</p>

            <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
            <p>Explore our website for in-depth articles, resources, and the latest advancements in brain tumor research. We are committed to providing you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions about your health and well-being.</p>
