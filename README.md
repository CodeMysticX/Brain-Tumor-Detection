Brain Tumor Detection System ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

ðŸ“œOverview
Welcome to our cutting-edge Brain Tumor Detection System! Our project harnesses the power of machine learning and medical imaging to create a sophisticated web application capable of detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images. Leveraging Flask, a powerful Python web framework, our system provides an intuitive interface for medical professionals and patients alike to upload MRI scans and receive instant, accurate tumor detection results.

ðŸš€ Key Features
1. Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms: Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze MRI scan images and identify potential brain tumors with remarkable precision.
2. Real-time Detection: Experience lightning-fast tumor detection results within seconds of uploading an MRI scan image.
3. User-friendly Interface: With a sleek and intuitive user interface, our web application makes it effortless for medical professionals and patients to navigate and utilize our detection system.
4. Secure and Private: We prioritize the security and privacy of our users' data, ensuring that all uploaded MRI scan images are handled with the utmost confidentiality and privacy.

ðŸ’»How it Works
1. Upload MRI Scan: Users simply upload their MRI scan images through our web interface.
2. Instant Analysis: Our machine learning algorithms analyze the uploaded images in real-time to identify any potential brain tumors.
3. Receive Results: Within seconds, users receive comprehensive results indicating the presence or absence of a brain tumor, along with relevant diagnostic information.
